# Windows93-Docs

Welcome to the most complete unofficial set of documentation pages available documenting windows 93.

> We used to use GitBook to document, but now this repository uses github pages and docsify.js  
> - Old Gitbook documentation here: https://win93.gitbook.io/old-windows93-docs/  
> - Gitbook documentation here: https://win93.gitbook.io/windows93-docs/  
> 
> **It is important to note that both of these are outdated, please use [the github pages site](https://win93-community.github.io/windows93-docs)**.

## Build

Luckily, windows93-docs is a static application (no node.js or other server-side things), so all you need to do is download the code/docs and spin up your web server! (stuff is in docs/ directory)
