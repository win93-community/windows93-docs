# A Brief History

Windows93's /b/, trollbox, and myspace have shut down in order to prevent the distribution of source files and myspace user passwords. This has slowed the distribution, however, it has not halted as 7z archives are being pirated in sister communities.\
On July 4th of 2021, jankenpopp released a statement in the form of a `txt` file, located at [https://windows93.net/dearCommunity.txt](https://windows93.net/dearCommunity.txt) (removed, a copy of it is stored below). Now removed, this letter explained how janken failed to encrypt MySpace93 passwords, how he hadnâ€™t expected such a large response initially, and a long explanation of how everything went down.

V3 is still planned. For updates, check Jankenpopp's reddit: [https://reddit.com/u/win93](https://reddit.com/u/win93)
