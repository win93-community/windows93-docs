### About the Apis

There are 51 APIs in Windows 93. Each of them begin with the dollar sign ($), except for the [`system42`](system/system42) api, a wrapper of the [`$kernel`](system/kernel) api..

### What other documentation sites are there?

* [http://www.windows93.net/docs](http://www.windows93.net/docs)

As you can see above, there aren't many other documentation sites with in-depth information about Windows93. This documentation site strives to be the best out of all 3. Many pages made here are based on windows93.net/docs, which is open-sourced at [https://github.com/domenicw1/Win93\_JS\_Docs](https://github.com/domenicw1/Win93\_JS\_Docs).
